**Objective:** Implement a mechanism to prevent the application from using the same topic twice for a given client and to update the client's sitemap with new post URLs.

**1. Initial Request & Discussion:**
- The user requested a feature to prevent duplicate content generation and to update the client's sitemap for internal linking.
- We discussed several options for implementing this feature, including:
    - A local storage-based approach.
    - A simple server-side solution.
    - Using a third-party Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).
- The user opted for a simple server-side solution.

**2. Implementation of the Backend Server:**
- A new backend server was created using Node.js, Express, and SQLite.
- The server exposes a simple REST API to manage used topics and sitemap URLs for each client.
- The API endpoints include:
    - `GET /api/clients/:clientId/used-topics`
    - `POST /api/clients/:clientId/used-topics`
    - `GET /api/clients/:clientId/sitemap-urls`
    - `POST /api/clients/:clientId/sitemap-urls`

**3. Frontend Integration:**
- The frontend application was modified to communicate with the new backend API instead of using local storage.
- The `ContentEditor` component was updated to send requests to the backend to record used topics and new sitemap URLs upon successful post publication.
- The `GenerationWorkflow` component was updated to check for duplicate topics by querying the backend before generating a new post.

**4. Deployment & Resolution:**
- The changes to both the frontend and the new backend were pushed to the GitHub repository.
- The application was successfully deployed to Netlify.
- The user confirmed that the new feature is working as expected.
