**SESSION LOG - AUGUST 13, 2025 (Part 2)**
-------------------------------------------

**Objective:** Implement sitemap integration and content generation enhancements, and debug sitemap URL issue.

**1. Feature Implementation:**
- Modified `types.ts` to add `sitemapUrl` and `sitemapUrls` to the `Client` interface.
- Modified `components/ClientForm.tsx` to add the "Sitemap URL" input field, integrate `useSitemap`, and pass sitemap data.
- Created `hooks/useSitemap.ts` to handle fetching and parsing sitemaps.
- Modified `components/ClientManager.tsx` to accept and save `sitemapUrls`.
- Modified `services/geminiService.ts` to update the AI prompt for content generation to include external and internal linking instructions using sitemap URLs.

**2. Debugging Sitemap URL Issue:**
- User reported "not a valid URL" error for `https://oneclickseo.com/post-sitemap.xml`.
- Diagnosed as a potential CORS issue due to cross-origin requests from the local development server.
- Implemented a proxy in `vite.config.ts` to route sitemap requests through the local server.
- Modified `hooks/useSitemap.ts` to use the proxied URL.

**3. Current Status:**
- All code modifications for the new features and CORS fix are complete.
- The local server is currently not running (user cancelled previous attempts to start it).
